Changes made in CCWatM in comparison to the original version
 
In settingsfile.ini
1.	Included option similar to calc_evaporation called no_meteo in settings file at line 29
2.	Implement paths to runoff, ET, and sum_gwrecharge in new section called [NO_METEO] check units!!! Line 205

In run_cwatm.py
1.	Change ‘PrecipitationMaps’ to ‘RunoffMaps’ in line 130 and 192

In cwatm_dynamic.py
1.	Turn off snow_frost.py. Line 74
2.	Turn off cappilarrise.py. Line 80
3.	Turn off landcoverType.py. Line 84
4.	Turn off runoff_concentration.py Line 95
5.	(if includewaterbodies = True) Remove everything related to self.var.totalET_WB in line 118ff.
6.	(if includeWaterDemand = True) Insert self.waterdemand_module.dynamic() instead of self.landcoverType_module.dynamic() (landcoverType.py called the water demand module before)
7.	Remove lines 110-141 to not compute tws
8.	Turn off waterquality.py. line 104

In cwatm_initial.py
1.	Remove initialization of evaporationPot (line 109, 149), snowfrost (line 111, 151), evaporation (114), capillarRise (119), interception (120), sealed_water (121), runoff_concentration (122, 162), water balance (126, 172), and water quality (127, 177)
2. Remove Modflow flag

In data_handling.py
1.	In def metaNetCDF(): change ‘PrecipitationMaps’ to ‘RunoffMaps’ in line 481 to 495

In timestep.py
1.	Change ‘PrecipitationMaps’ to ‘RunoffMaps’ in error message at line 289 and 290.

In readmeteo.py
1.	Included option similar to calc_evaporation called no_meteo in settings file at line 29 and implement that in readmeteo at line 193
2.	Change first part of initial after  #fit meteorological forcing data to size and resolution of mask map in lines 97-101 to read in runoff maps
3.	Implement maps to stuff listed above Line 175-177
4.	Included option ‘no_meteo’ and read in runoff, actualET, and sum_gwRecharge, etc. check units again!!! And conversion factor… Units should be m/day?, check if buffer is necessary for gwRecharge

In routing_kinematic.py
1.	Compute ‘self.var.EvapoChannel’ using open water evaporation in Line 355. Comment out line 354. Check later for factor?

In runoff_concentration.py
1.	If ‘includeRunoffConcentration = False’ turn off

In landcoverType.py
File has been almost entirely rewritten, most of initial is removed
1.	Remove setting total ET to zero in line 294 and 879.
2.	Remove self.var.totalSto in line 501 and 882
3.	Move initialization of self.var.ElevationStD  to initial of landcoverType.py (line 558)

In lakes_res_small.py
1.	Remove modification of runoff in line 284 (test again!!!)

In irrigation.py
File has been almost entirely rewritten
1.	soilWaterStorage = root zone soil moisture (Line 150)
2.	readAvlWater = soilWaterStorage - (self.var.wwp1[No] + self.var.wwp2[No]) (Line 165)
3.	Load time-varying crop coefficient maps (line 126-133)
4.	Load self.var.minCropKC= loadmap('minCropKC') in initial (line 106)

In setup.py
1. Update Name, url, packages

In run_cwatm.py
1. Update Name
